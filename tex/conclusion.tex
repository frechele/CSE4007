In this paper we have compared some light-weight machine learning algorithms with two perspective: efficiency and translation invariance.
We trained the models using only the CPU with a small dataset.
In addition, we created translated validation set that is modified version of the original dataset to test translation invariance.
As a result, in general, Convolutional Neural Network is the most suitable model for computer vision tasks.
However, if the condition that all images are centered is added, Support Vector Machine is also good for using because it is efficient enough.
